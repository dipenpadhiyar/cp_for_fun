Arrays are constant in size:-
    char arr[5] = "Dipen"; or   string arr[5] = "jay";
             ^                             ^
             |                             |
             |                             |
          fix 5 size                   fix 5 siz

solution is vector whic is dynamical in nature.

vector<int ,int > data;
